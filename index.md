A second-year Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Currently, I work as a Database Intern and Energy Data Analyst at UMass Lowell.

I am also actively engaged in Deep Learning research, with my recent paper accepted to IEEE. Additionally, I have completed various projects in Web Development.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer, where I designed applications that achieved 20% cost savings and increased efficiency by 50%, saving the team over 20 hours per week.

I am actively seeking internship and full-time opportunities starting from May 2025.
